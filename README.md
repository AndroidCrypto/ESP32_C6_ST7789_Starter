# ESP32 C6 ST7789 Starter
Getting started with an ESP32-C6 Supermini device and a TFT display ST7789.

This is the accompanying repository for my article "**Getting Started with an ESP32-C6 Supermini device connected to an ST7789 TFTÂ display**".

## Important note

You need to modify the display library TFT_eSPI to get the code to work. Please find instructions on how to do this in my forked TFT_eSPI repository here on GitHub: [https://github.com/AndroidCrypto/TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/AndroidCrypto/TFT_eSPI).
